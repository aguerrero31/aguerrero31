Hi there! My name is Andrew, I am a software tester that is currently working towards a Computer Science degree. I should be finishing up my associates around April of 2025, and my Bachelors around April of 2028 (I am taking things relatively slow due to the full time job, about half speed of a typical 4-year degree).

Most of my experience at the moment is with C++, but I also have experience with Python, Java, and C#. I work with Python occasionally for my day job, helping out the software engineers with test automation. I have also taken classes on SQL, Data Structures & Algorithms, and so on, which I quite enjoyed. I am taking classes year round until my degree is done, so I am constantly learning things and developing new skills!

Current classes: Calculus II, Software Engineering I

Currently working on:
- SchemaScan
- Rewriting my linked list class from my Data Structures & Algorithms course
- Rewriting my expression tree class from that same course
- Utilizing the expresssion tree solver to create a Calculus solver
- Updating my GitHub page with projects for data structures, algorithms, and other useful mini-libraries created from scratch in C++ (mosly avoiding the use of the std library except where "unavoidable")

Link to my separate educational profile [here](github.com/aguerreroEDU). Most of my projects here were created with GitHub Education, so I don't think they show up unfortunately. Most things there will be done here but better soon enough, anyways
