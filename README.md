Hi there! My name is Andrew, I am a software tester that is currently working towards a Computer Science degree. I should be finishing up my associates around April of 2025, and my Bachelors around April of 2028 (I am taking things relatively slow due to the full time job, about half speed of a typical 4-year degree).

Most of my experience at the moment is with C++, but I also have experience with Python, Java, and C#. I work with Python occasionally for my day job, helping out the software engineers with test automation. I have taken web development courses and learned HTML/CSS/JS, but web development isn't really something that I enjoy much; I am a back end type of guy. I have also taken an SQL class, which I quite enjoyed. I am taking classes year round until my degree is done, so I am constantly learning things and developing new skills!

Current classes: Calculus II, Software Engineering I (Summer 2024)

Currently working on:
- Setting up this github page
- SchemaScan
- Rewriting my linked list class from my Data Structures & Algorithms course
- Rewriting my expression tree class from that same course
- Using said expression tree class to create a program that can do some Calculus
- Updating my GitHub page with projects for data structures, algorithms, and other useful mini-libraries created from scratch in C++ (mosly avoiding the use of the std library except where "unavoidable")

Link to my separate educational profile [here](github.com/aguerreroEDU). Most of my projects here were created with GitHub Education, so I don't think they show up unfortunately. Most things there will be done here but better soon enough, anyways
